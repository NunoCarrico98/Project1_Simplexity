* Francisco Freixo - a21701661
* Nuno Carriço - a21701393

## Who did what?

**Francisco Freixo:**
* Fluxogram, UML Diagram and README
* Organization of classes 
* Color and Shape enums
* Initial version of the class Pieces
* Class Board
* Coordinates constructor
* Visualization 
* Method that asks for user shape 
* Initial version of game loop
* Piece counter (Cubes and Cilinders)
* Check for full Column 
* Improve Visualization
* Comments to Shape, Color, Piece and Player classes

**Nuno Carriço:**
* Fluxogram, UML Diagram and README
* Change Variables to Properties on classes Coordinates and Piece
* Method GetPiece
* Class Player
* Method that asks for column
* Method SetPiece
* Tie verification
* Method GetShape and GetColor
* Win verification
* Class Game - game loop
* Comments to Program, Coordinates, Board, Game, Renderer and WinChecker classes

## Our solution



### Fluxogram

![Simplexity_Fluxogram](/uploads/283c999fc0fa3a6c791675c933122de5/Simplexity_Fluxogram_-_Page_1__1_.png)

**Picture 1** - Our Fluxogram represents the flow of the program, in this case, the Game Loop.

### UML Diagram

(uml)

**Picture 2** - Our UML Diagram shows the structure of our program as well as the relationships between our classes. 

### Data structures

For our board we used an array of pieces. These Pieces are represented by a enumertaion containing five different variants.
|Piece|
|-|
|None|
|RedCube|
|RedCilinder|
|WhiteCube|
|WhiteCilinder|
